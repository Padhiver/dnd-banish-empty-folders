# D&D - Banish Empty Folders
The D&D system is starting to have a lot of content, and this content sometimes leaves an empty folder that takes up space, not anymore. Hide these empty folders, in addition to being able to hide the system's SRD compendiums.
The SRD compendiums are still there, so any link will work, but the folder is just hidden.

## About Request
I'm open to requests if you think other references or other things would be useful in the menu, but I'm not a programmer, it's all just tinkering, so it'll depend on the difficulty!
